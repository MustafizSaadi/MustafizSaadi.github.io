<h1>About me</h1>
I am a software engineer and currently working at [Enosis Solutions](https://www.enosisbd.com/) for approximately two years. I have completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Dhaka. I am a hardâ€‘working, passionate, and enthusiastic desktop application developer with expertise in Delphi, .NET, and Qt frameworks. I am committed to devising efficient solutions for challenging real-world problems and tasks within time constraints and learning new technologies whenever necessary. Being a team member, I love to work in a cooperative and coordinated environment. In my leisure time, I watch cricket and documentaries on history and politics.
