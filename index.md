<h1>About me</h1>
I am a hardâ€‘working, passionate, and enthusiastic software engineer with 3+ years of industry experience. I am currently working at [Enosis Solutions](https://www.enosisbd.com/) as a Senior Software Engineer. I have completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Dhaka. I have expertise in developing desktop applications with frameworks like Qt, .NET, and Delphi. I also have experience in developing web applications with .NET Core as backend and ReactJS as front-end frameworks. I am committed to devising efficient solutions for challenging real-world problems and tasks within time constraints and learning new technologies whenever necessary. Being a team member, I love to work in a cooperative and coordinated environment. In my leisure time, I watch cricket and documentaries on history and politics.
