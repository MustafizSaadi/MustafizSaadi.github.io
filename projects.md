<h3> Undergraduate Thesis </h3>

**Speeding up Sub-Optimal Multi-Agent Path Finding Algorithms**  
*Undergraduate Thesis, 2020-21*

**Description:** A research work to improve the state-of-the-art Sub-Optimal Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) algorithms, namely, Priority
Inheritance with Backtracking (PIBT) and Enhanced Conflict Based Search (ECBS). To improve the runtime of PIBT, a Shortest Distance Vector is utilized which stores the cost of the conflict-
free shortest path among the agents. Besides, an adaptive agent-specific sub-optimal bounding approach, called ASB-ECBS is utilized to reduce the runtime
of ECBS, which assigns sub-optimal bound to each agent considering the total number of conflicts occurring
with other agents. The improvements were tested on benchmark maps both qualitatively and quantitively and they were found to
be reducing the runtime of the Sub-Optimal MAPF algorithms without compromising the solution quality.  
**Domain:** Multi-Agent Systems, Path Finding Algorithms
